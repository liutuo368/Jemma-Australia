        <h3>What we are doing</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Technology has made our lives easier in so many ways however there’s still more that it can do. You’ve
            probably heard the phrase ‘work smarter, not harder’ so that’s what we did.
            <br><br>
            Our unique features are what sets us apart. They have been implemented based on feedback from both sides of
            the relationship and designed to make it a smooth experience, because whichever side you’re on, we know you
            get frustrated sometimes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-5 md-5">
        <h3>Why choose us</h3>
        <br>
        <p>You may have seen similar services to Jemma although we know what they do and don’t do, and the latter was
            the problem.
            <br><br>
            We also know that they only do little parts of the puzzle and no-one likes having to deal with multiple
            companies to get one thing done. That’s why we’re an all in one solution.
            <br><br>
            This is all common feedback we’ve heard many times and we knew something had to be done about it.
            <br><br>
            So what makes us different?
            <br><br>
            Jemma doesn’t charge you to sign up, nor does it charge you to advertise your business.
            There are no hidden fees. Customers can browse their local tradespeople and hire them, only paying for the
            cost of the service that the tradesperson set.
            <br><br>
            Our research indicates that people find it frustrating to find and book a reliable, trustworthy tradesperson
            without having to call around. With Jemma you can see when they’re available and their ratings and reviews
            without having to pick up the phone. Once you’ve found them you can agree on a price, book it in, and
            eventually confirm and pay, all from the website or mobile app. Just like ordering a pizza!
            <br><br>
            Feedback is what started us so we believe that continual feedback is vital to keep it going. We’ll keep
            listening and adding features as we go along because whether you’re a tradesperson or a customer, everyone
            deserves to have a hassle free experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Jemma was founded by 9 Australians based in Canberra. We heard and experienced the problems with the current
            business model many times and wondered why no-one had bothered to solve them. So we got to work.</p>
